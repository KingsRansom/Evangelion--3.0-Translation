00:11:03 {Woman}       Pod 02-Dash has reached operation altitude.
00:11:07 {Woman}       It has settled into the targeted orbit.
00:11:08 {Man}         Due to insufficient altitude, Pod 08 was unable to breach target orbital range.
00:11:13 {Aoba}        Copy that.
00:11:14 {Aoba}        02-Dash will conduct a solo operation.

00:12:27 {Woman}       180-degree rotation complete.
00:12:28 {Hyuga}       Roger.
00:12:29 {Hyuga}       Pod 02-Dash will start transitioning to the intercept orbit.
00:12:32 {Hyuga}       Now commencing the operation.
00:12:34 {Aoba}        All remote guiding will now be cut.
00:12:36 {Aoba}        Unit will be controlled manually.
00:12:38 {Hyuga}       Good luck.
00:02:32 {Woman}       Unit is on intercept course with the target.
00:02:34 {Woman}       Eighty measures until contact.
00:02:37 {Woman}       Confirming target.
00:02:38 {Man}         Contact point is unchanged.
00:02:40 {Woman}       Maintaining Shift-M. No problems.
00:02:43 {Misato}      02-Dash, prepare to rendezvous.
00:02:45 {Misato}      08 is lacking altitude, so it can only assist you in the ninety-six seconds until re-entry.
00:12:59 {Misato}      Finish this by then.
00:13:01 {Hyuga}       Reflective waves detected in target space.
00:13:03 {Hyuga}       It's jamming us!
00:13:04 {Aoba}        It's just the auto-defense system's mass weapon.
00:13:06 {Aoba}        No need to worry.
00:13:10 {Man}         Burst shockwaves emanating!
00:13:11 {Man}         Incoming in three... two... one...
00:13:19 {Aoba}        Second wave incoming. Blood type blue.
00:13:20 {Aoba}        They're a pesky bunch.
00:13:22 {Man}         Identifying the approaching body...
00:03:15 {Man}         Confirmed to be Mk. 04A.
00:03:25 {Asuka}       An Anti-A.T. Field!
00:13:39 {Asuka}       This thing's useless!
00:03:34 {Asuka}       It's just getting in my way!
00:13:45 {Asuka}       Glasses, enough with the damn singing!
00:13:48 {Asuka}       It's annoying as hell!
00:13:52 {Asuka}       Support fire was two seconds late!
00:13:58 {Mari}        And you're three seconds ahead of position.
00:14:00 {Asuka}       It's called adapting to the situation. Keep up with me!
00:14:03 {Mari}        As you command,
00:14:05 {Mari}        Princess!
00:14:14 {Asuka}       Got through the Fullerene Shift.
00:04:07 {Asuka}       Breaking into Final Defense Area 89.
00:04:10 {Asuka}       The target is moving!
00:04:16 {Asuka}       No time to correct my orbit!
00:04:17 {Asuka}       I'll just have to brute this!
00:04:40 {Asuka}       Decelerate!
00:04:46 {Asuka}       Eight!
00:04:47 {Asuka}       Seven!
00:04:48 {Asuka}       Six!
00:04:49 {Asuka}       Five!
00:04:50 {Asuka}       Four!
00:04:51 {Asuka}       Three!
00:04:53 {Asuka}       Two!
00:04:54 {Asuka}       One!
00:04:55 {Asuka}       Terminating combustion!
00:15:12 {Midori}      02-Dash has jettisoned the last boosters.
00:15:14 {Midori}      Ensuring safe distance for re-entry.
00:15:16 {Man}         Orbital errors are within correctable ranges. Recalculating angle of entry.
00:05:09 {Asuka}       Successfully seized the target.
00:05:11 {Asuka}       Returning to base.
00:05:13 {Misato}      Roger.
00:05:14 {Misato}      We'll be waiting at the retrieval point.
00:05:16 {Misato}      The join code is Saturn V.
00:05:17 {Asuka}       Roger.
00:05:19 {Asuka}       Blood type blue?
00:05:20 {Asuka}       Where?!
00:05:25 {Woman}       The interfering object is Mk. 04B.
00:05:27 {Woman}       It is deploying a field-reflective coating.
00:05:29 {Asuka}       The nerve!
00:05:30 {Asuka}       Right before re-entry, too.
00:05:33 {Asuka}       Glasses, back-up!
00:05:35 {Mari}        Sorry!
00:05:37 {Mari}        I don't have enough altitude, so see ya!
00:05:39 {Mari}        I'll leave the rest to y-...
00:05:42 {Asuka}       Ugh! She's useless!
00:05:44 {Asuka}       Damn, this thing's stubborn!
00:05:46 {Asuka}       Nobody told me about this!
00:05:59 {Asuka}       What's with this light?!
00:06:01 {Asuka}       The A.T. Field isn't neutralizing it!
00:06:05 {Asuka}       I gotta take out the core block!
00:06:06 {Asuka}       You're not getting away!
00:06:10 {Asuka}       Crap! I can't maintain my descent angle!
00:06:12 {Asuka}       My unit'll fall apart at this rate!
00:06:14 {Misato}      02-Dash, completing the mission takes top priority!
00:06:18 {Misato}      Don't let go of the target object, even if it means sacrificing the unit.
00:06:20 {Asuka}       I already know that!
00:06:41 {Asuka}       Do something, you idiot, Shinji!
00:07:23 {Kaworu}      Welcome home, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:07:26 {Kaworu}      I've been waiting for you.
00:07:42 {Sakura}      Cardiopulmonary function is nominal.
00:07:44 {Sakura}      No discernible paralysis of the extremities.
00:07:46 {Sakura}      Yes. He has opened his eyes.
00:07:50 {Sakura}      Can you understand me?
00:07:55 {Shinji}      What is this place?
00:07:58 {Sakura}      He is capable of speech.
00:07:59 {Sakura}      He seems to have returned to a conscious state.
00:08:03 {Shinji}      I could've sworn I was saving Ayanami...
00:08:06 {Sakura}      Yes, continuity of memory also seems acceptable.
00:08:10 {Shinji}      Um, where's Ayanami...?
00:08:13 {Sakura}      Is this someone you know?
00:08:18 {Shinji}      It's... me.
00:08:21 {Sakura}      He is capable of self-recognition as well.
00:08:22 {Sakura}      No apparent problems.
00:08:24 {Shinji}      What's this?
00:18:32 {Sakura}      Do you need to urinate? Are you hungry?
00:18:36 {Woman}       Delivery list for supplying operations cleared up to 86%.
00:18:38 {Koji}        Maintain the power output of the online N2 reactors at 90%.
00:18:42 {Midori}      No ships visible within a radius of twelve hundred.
00:18:42 {Koji}        Open the pressure valves manually.
00:18:44 {Midori}      No unidentified flying objects can be confirmed, either.
00:18:45 {Koji}        Don't worry about the condenser.
00:18:46 {Aoba}        Prioritize ships in D Block for personnel transfer.
00:18:48 {Hyuga}       Insufficient personnel for the ration transfer operation! 
00:18:50 {Sumire}      Checking port and starboard gyrocompasses three and five.
00:18:51 {Hyuga}       Expedite this, on the double!
00:18:53 {Sumire}      The gauges are inaccurate. Requesting recalibration.
00:18:54 {Tama}        Checking the ships' outfitting and roadmaps.
00:18:56 {Tama}        Armament linkage is 3% behind schedule.
00:08:53 {Sakura}      Specimen BM03 is in our custody.
00:08:56 {Misato}      Understood.
00:08:57 {Misato}      Release the restraints.
00:09:00 {Misato}      You are all dismissed.
00:09:25 {Shinji}      Misato-san...
00:09:28 {Misato}      It is Ikari Shinji-kun, isn't it?
00:09:31 {Ritsuko}     So it would seem.
00:09:32 {Ritsuko}     His physical data is identical to Code Third Boy.
00:09:37 {Ritsuko}     Post-natal dental work and body composition perfectly match those from Near Third Impact.
00:09:43 {Ritsuko}     We are now analyzing his deep level sync test results.
00:09:46 {Misato}      And the DSS Choker on his neck?
00:09:49 {Ritsuko}     It has already been installed, Captain Katsuragi.
00:09:52 {Shinji}      Captain Katsuragi...?
00:09:54 {Shinji}      So it really is you, Misato-san?
00:20:06 {Shinji}      Huh?
00:10:03 {Ritsuko}     Activation nominal.
00:10:04 {Ritsuko}     Passcode is set for your personal use, Captain.
00:10:07 {Misato}      Understood.
00:10:11 {Shinji}      What is this thing?!
00:10:14 {Shinji}      Please, take it off already!
00:10:18 {Sakura}      There's no way that's ever coming off.
00:10:22 {Misato}      We're done with him.
00:10:24 {Misato}      Take him to quarantine.
00:10:28 {Midori}      Decoys 01 and 05 destroyed.
00:10:30 {Midori}      Wavelength acquired.
00:10:31 {Midori}      What could this be?
00:10:33 {Hyuga}       It's blood type blue.
00:10:34 {Hyuga}       Target identified.
00:10:36 {Hyuga}       Mk. 4C.
00:10:37 {Hyuga}       It's the Nemesis Series.
00:20:47 {Misato}      They're back...
00:20:48 {Midori (BG)} Targets identified as Mk. 04C.
00:20:48 {Ritsuko}     They're advancing on all sides.
00:20:50 {Ritsuko}     They intend to cordon us here, to start with.
00:20:51 {Midori (BG)} Destruction of decoys 02 and 06 confirmed. #not in UTW#
00:10:45 {Misato}      We can't afford to move from here yet.
00:10:48 {Misato}      Stop work on everything except the main engine.
00:10:50 {Misato}      All ships to Battle Stations Two!
00:10:53 {Misato}      Target the entire Nemesis Series!
00:10:55 {Ritsuko}     Roger.
00:10:56 {Ritsuko}     All ships to Battle Stations Two.
00:10:58 {Hyuga}       Prepare for aerial, sea, and underwater battle!
00:11:02 {Aoba}        Abandon transfer of supplies.
00:21:11 {Aoba}        Prioritize transfer of personnel!
00:21:12 {Woman}       All fleets, abandon transfer of supplies. Prioritize transfer of personnel.
00:21:14 {Man}         Prepare for aerial, sea, and underwater battle.
00:21:16 {Woman}       Continue work on the main engine.
00:21:17 {Man}         Prepare long-range cannons for torpedo warfare.
00:21:18 {Man}         Prepare switching of all power supply lines.
00:21:22 {Woman}       All aircraft are to withdraw from our current air space at once.
00:21:25 {Woman}       Hurry to Meeting Point Two.
00:21:27 {Man}         Abandon all remaining cargo.
00:21:28 {Man}         Transfer of personnel takes top priority.
00:21:30 {Man}         Continue outfitting the ships!
00:21:31 {Man}         Keep the work going until the very last minute!
00:21:33 {Man}         All who can help with the power lines, assemble during launch.
00:21:36 {Woman}       Prepare all gun turrets for individual firing.
00:21:38 {Woman}       Activate all remote control and interlocking systems.
00:21:41 {Woman}       Please be ready for unforeseen hostilities. 
00:21:42 {Koji}        Keep working on the injection of the main engine transmission system.
00:21:45 {Koji}        Hurry!
00:21:47 {Man}         N2 reactor operating at 99% output.
00:21:50 {Woman}       Initiating main power system injection.
00:11:44 {Woman}       Opening valves up to number 90.
00:11:46 {Woman}       Transmission pipe connected.
00:11:48 {Woman}       No problems detected in the port, and 3rd and 4th cargo cage.
00:11:51 {Man}         Roger.
00:11:52 {Man}         Opening all valves up to 90.
00:11:54 {Man}         Begin energy injection.
00:11:56 {Woman}       Injecting power to N2 reactor.
00:11:58 {Woman}       All nominal.
00:11:58 {Woman}       Verifying the interior of the LCL tube.
00:12:01 {Woman}       Filtration system is go.
00:12:03 {Maya}        Battle stations!
00:12:04 {Maya}        Get back to your departments.
00:12:06 {Maya}        You there! No idling!
00:12:08 {Worker}      You're asking for the impossible, Ma'am!
00:12:10 {Worker}      We are something of a mixed group with civilians amongst us, after all.
00:12:13 {Maya}        No excuses!
00:12:15 {Maya}        Get to work!
00:12:17 {Maya}        Ugh, this is why I can't stand younger men.
00:12:21 {Tama}        Umm... interrupting the transfer here.
00:12:24 {Tama}        Commencing lockdown of barrier walls... is this it?
00:12:27 {Midori}      The sonar is in this direction with the bow of the anti-air ship as reference.
00:12:31 {Aoba}        Kitakami! 
00:12:32 {Aoba}        What's the status of the procedures on deck?
00:12:34 {Midori}      Am I in charge of that?
00:12:36 {Aoba}        That's your post! Of course!
00:12:38 {Midori}      What? For real?
00:12:43 {Sakura}      The start-up is dangerous. 
00:12:45 {Sakura}      Let's stay here!
00:12:47 {Woman (BG)}  Preparations for all anti-air defenses concluded, including the guided missiles of the battle ship.
00:12:49 {Sakura}      Having battle stations on the bridge... 
00:12:52 {Misato}      Roger.
00:12:52 {Sakura}      It's so nerve-wracking!
00:12:53 {Misato}      Activate all anti-air systems.
00:12:55 {Misato}      Safeguarding Eva-01 is our number-one priority.
00:12:57 {Shinji}      ...Eva-01?
00:13:07 {Midori}      It's here!
00:13:08 {Midori}      Confirming the targets' pillars of light.
00:13:10 {Midori}      Its... numbers are increasing somehow!
00:13:13 {Aoba}        We can't grasp the targets' core blocks.
00:13:15 {Aoba}        It is probably being concealed on the outside of a phased cocoon.
00:13:18 {Ritsuko}     This is bad.
00:13:20 {Ritsuko}     At this rate, we'll be on the receiving end of a saturation bombing.
00:13:22 {Midori}      600 seconds until contact.
00:13:24 {Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi,
00:13:25 {Ritsuko}     I propose an immediate dispersal of the fleets.
00:13:29 {Ritsuko}     We have insufficient crew and limited resources.
00:13:32 {Ritsuko}     Compounding the problem, this main ship's camouflage equipment is incomplete.
00:13:34 {Ritsuko}     On top of that, we cannot attack to capture the targets' core blocks.
00:13:38 {Ritsuko}     In other words, our chance of winning is zero.
00:13:41 {Ritsuko}     At this point, we should retreat like we usually do. 
00:13:43 {Ritsuko}     There is no way.
00:13:45 {Ritsuko}     Captain Katsuragi!
00:13:47 {Misato}      And that's why I will change the status quo and bring our anxieties to an end.
00:13:52 {Misato}      Vice Captain, we're going to fly.
00:13:54 {Ritsuko}     Fly?! 
00:13:55 {Ritsuko}     You can't be thinking of using the main ship?
00:13:57 {Misato}      All hands, prepare for launch! 
00:14:00 {Misato}      Prepare for ignition of the main engines!
00:14:03 {Ritsuko}     It's too reckless to use the main ship all of a sudden, Captain Katsuragi!
00:14:06 {Tama}        I agree! 
00:14:07 {Tama}        We haven't even run a test flight. It's too dangerous.
00:14:09 {Sumire}      The anti-gravity also hasn't been tested. 
00:14:11 {Sumire}      I can't vouche for it. 
00:14:13 {Midori}      I don't want to fight battles that can't be won. 
00:14:15 {Midori}      I don't want to die just yet.
00:14:17 {Koji}        You die when you die. That's all there is to it. 
00:14:19 {Koji}        Quit your whining, kids.
00:14:21 {Midori}      / Wah... Old folks should be more careful! {ヴァーッ！年寄りなら慎重に行くもんでしょ！？}
00:14:25 {Misato}      I am aware of the recklessness. 
00:14:27 {Misato}      We will use this ship as decoy and fish them out to the surface!
00:14:30 {Misato}      The power to kill gods. I will see it through to the end.
00:14:33 {Ritsuko}     But the most important ignition system has not been installed. 
00:14:36 {Ritsuko}     Don't tell me you're going to use the Evas?
00:14:39 {Misato}      Mari!
00:14:40 {Mari}        Eva-08 isn't ready yet.
00:14:41 {Misato}      Asuka!
00:14:42 {Shinji}      ...Asuka?
00:14:46 {Asuka}       I'm already on it! 
00:14:47 {Asuka}       I just have to shove the ignition engine in, right?
00:14:50 {Misato}      I'm counting on you.
00:14:51 {Ritsuko}     But there is a problem with the barrier density around the ship. 
00:14:54 {Ritsuko}     Plus, isn't there work being done on the bridge?
00:14:56 {Asuka}       Well, "prioritize the objective, human life expendable" is the Captain's motto, after all.
00:15:00 {Asuka}       I'm going all out! 
00:15:01 {Asuka}       Eva Unit 02', activate!

00:15:20 {Asuka}       Really, such a boring entrance for my unit's new looks.
00:15:32 {Shinji}      It really is Eva-02. 
00:15:33 {Shinji}      Thank god. Asuka is okay.

00:16:11 {Shinji}      Eva-01 is here, isn't it? 
00:16:14 {Shinji}      I'll pilot too! 
00:16:15 {Shinji}      I'll help Asuka!
00:16:20 {Shinji}      You don't need me to pilot Eva-01? 
00:16:23 {Shinji}      Misato-san?!
00:16:26 {Ritsuko}     That's correct. 
00:16:27 {Ritsuko}     There's no need for you to pilot the Eva.

00:24:07 {Midori}      We really won.
00:24:09 {Koji}        How totally reckless. 
00:24:12 {Koji}        Well, she's an even more interesting captain than Kaji said.
00:24:15 {Ritsuko}     So this is the power to kill gods. 
00:24:17 {Ritsuko}     Wunder really is the ship of hope.
00:25:00 {Sakura}      Specimen BM03, Tentative Name Ikari Shinji-san... 
00:25:03 {Sakura}      The executive officer will have a word with you.
00:25:06 {Shinji}      This is Eva-01...?
00:25:08 {Ritsuko}     Yes. Eva-01 is being used as the main engine of this ship. 
00:25:13 {Ritsuko}     Consequently, you serve no function as a pilot. 
00:25:16 {Shinji}      Ah, so I really am not needed. 
00:25:19 {Ritsuko}     Also, your sync test results are in. 
00:25:23 {Ritsuko}     The sync rate is 0.00%.
00:25:26 {Ritsuko}     Even if you were to get in the Eva, it wouldn't activate.
00:25:30 {Sakura}      Really?
00:25:31 {Sakura}      Isn't that great news, Ikari-san? 
00:25:33 {Ritsuko}     Even so, we cannot overlook the fact that, earlier, Eva-01 suddenly entered an Awakened state for 12 seconds.
00:25:39 {Ritsuko}     As a result, the DSS Choker has been installed on you.
00:25:44 {Shinji}      What is this?
00:25:45 {Ritsuko}     Safety for us. 
00:25:48 {Ritsuko}     It's a physical safety device to circumvent Awakenings. 
00:25:51 {Ritsuko}     And it is also a symbol of your punishment.
00:25:55 {Shinji}      What does it do?
00:25:56 {Ritsuko}     If you lose control of your emotions while piloting an Eva and become unable to suppress the risk of Awakening,
00:26:04 {Ritsuko}     this will intervene by terminating your life.
00:26:08 {Shinji}      Does that mean... I will die?
00:26:13 {Ritsuko}     I will not deny that.
00:26:16 {Shinji}      No way...
00:26:18 {Shinji}      Misato-san, what is all this about dying?
00:26:22 {Shinji}      This is weird, Misato-san! 
00:26:24 {Shinji}      Suddenly it's all so confusing, and I don't understand anything!
00:26:27 {Ritsuko}     It can't be helped that you're confused.
00:26:28 {Ritsuko}     Second Lieutenant!
00:26:29 {Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!
00:26:30 {Ritsuko}     Introduce yourself.
00:26:31 {Sakura}      Yes, ma'am!
00:26:33 {Sakura}      Um, it's late, but I'm the medical officer in charge,
00:26:38 {Sakura}      2nd Lt. Suzuhara Sakura.
00:26:41 {Sakura}      Nice to meet you.
00:26:43 {Shinji}      Ah, s-same.
00:26:46 {Shinji}      But, "Suzuhara"...
00:26:48 {Shinji}      Are you Toji's...?
00:26:50 {Sakura}      Ah, yes.
00:26:51 {Sakura}      I owe everything to my big brother. 
00:26:53 {Sakura}      I'm his little sister Sakura.
00:26:55 {Shinji}      Little sister?
00:26:56 {Shinji}      Don't you mean older sister?
00:26:57 {Sakura}      No, little sister.
00:27:01 {Shinji}      Little sister...? How?
00:27:04 {Asuka}       Fourteen years have passed since then. 
00:27:07 {Asuka}       Stupid Shinji.
00:27:09 {Shinji}      Huh? Ah, Asuka!
00:27:15 {Shinji}      Thank goodness. 
00:27:16 {Shinji}      You really are safe, Asuka!
00:27:23 {Asuka}       I can't stand it. 
00:27:25 {Asuka}       I've been holding this in.
00:27:34 {Shinji}      What was that all about...?
00:27:36 {Asuka}       Built up anger and grief.
00:27:39 {Shinji}      What do you mean...? 
00:27:41 {Shinji}      Uh, Asuka, your left eye...
00:27:44 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:27:46 {Shinji}      Asuka, you said it's been fourteen years,
00:27:49 {Shinji}      but the only thing that's changed about you is that eyepatch.
00:27:52 {Asuka}       Right. It's the Curse of Eva.
00:27:55 {Shinji}      A curse?
00:27:59 {Shinji}      Wait! 
00:28:00 {Shinji}      Asuka, maybe you know! 
00:28:02 {Shinji}      Where's Ayanami?!
00:28:05 {Asuka}       Dunno.
00:28:06 {Shinji}      You don't know...? 
00:28:08 {Shinji}      But I saved her!
00:28:10 {Asuka}       All this fuss over just one person.
00:28:12 {Asuka}       This world doesn't have time to cater to your ego.
00:28:16 {Asuka}       Isn't that right, Captain Katsuragi?
00:28:22 {Shinji}      Asuka!
00:28:23 {Shinji}      Misato-san, where's Ayanami?! 
00:28:26 {Shinji}      You've got to tell me!
00:28:27 {Misato}      Shinji-kun, Ayanami Rei no longer exists.
00:28:31 {Shinji}      No, I saved her, I know I did.
00:28:34 {Shinji}      She must still be in Eva-01's plug.
00:28:37 {Shinji}      Please, search for her!
00:28:38 {Ritsuko}     We've already conducted a thorough sweep of Eva-01.
00:28:42 {Ritsuko}     We only found you.
00:28:45 {Ritsuko}     And for some reason, this was restored.
00:28:48 {Ritsuko}     The inspection yielded no problems. We'll return it.
00:28:52 {Shinji}      My father's...
00:28:55 {Shinji}      Ayanami was holding it then.
00:28:58 {Shinji}      So I saved her, didn't I?
00:29:01 {Shinji}      What?!
00:29:04 {Misato}      It's me.
00:29:06 {Hyuga}       Target is on the rear deck! 
00:29:07 {Hyuga}       It suddenly closed in on us!
00:29:09 {Misato}      So the champion is on the scene... 
00:29:10 {Misato}      All fleets to Battle Stations One. 
00:29:12 {Misato}      Safeguarding Eva-01 is top priority!
00:29:14 {Asuka}       Eva-08, you're ready to go, right?
00:29:16 {Mari}        But of course.
00:29:18 {Mari}        I'm right on top of it, Princess. 
00:29:19 {Mari}        By the way, how was Puppy Boy?
00:29:22 {Mari}        Is he obediently staying put?
00:29:24 {Asuka}       Nothing's changed about his stupid lowly face.
00:29:28 {Mari}        Oh, so you went to go see his face, did you?
00:29:31 {Asuka}       No!
00:29:32 {Asuka}       I went to throw a punch at it!
00:29:34 {Asuka}       I feel much better now.
00:29:35 {Shinji}      Misato-san, Ritsuko-san!
00:29:37 {Shinji}      Just who is coming?
00:29:39 {Shinji}      Is it a new Angel?!
00:29:41 {Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:29:44 {Shinji}      Ayanami?
00:29:46 {Shinji}      That was Ayanami's voice just now, wasn't it?!
00:29:49 {Shinji}      Misa-
00:29:53 {Shinji}      What is going on here?!
00:29:55 {Sakura}      Preparations complete!
00:29:56 {Sakura}      Ikari-san, this way!
00:29:58 {Rei}         Ikari-kun, where are you?
00:30:01 {Shinji}      It really is Ayanami.
00:30:04 {Shinji}      It's Ayanami!
00:30:06 {Sakura}      Ikari-san! Quickly!
00:30:11 {Shinji}      Enough.
00:30:13 {Shinji}      Ayanami, I'm right here!
00:30:28 {Shinji}      Eva... Unit 00.
00:30:30 {Rei}         Ikari-kun...
00:30:32 {Rei}         Come this way.
00:30:35 {Misato}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun.
00:30:37 {Misato}      Just stay right here.
00:30:38 {Shinji}      What's with that, Misato-san?
00:30:41 {Shinji}      Weren't you just saying a moment ago that you didn't need me?
00:30:43 {Misato}      Even so, you'll be kept in our custody.
00:30:45 {Shinji}      That's just too one-sided!
00:30:53 {Shinji}      Please stop it! 
00:50:53 {Shinji}      The target is an Eva!
00:30:55 {Misato}      That's why.
00:30:57 {Misato}      We will eradicate all of Nerv's Evas.
00:30:59 {Shinji}      Nerv... 
00:31:01 {Shinji}      This isn't Nerv, too?
00:31:02 {Misato}      We are Wille, an organization dedicated to Nerv's annihilation.
00:31:07 {Shinji}      That's... 
00:31:09 {Shinji}      No, but it's being piloted by Ayanami!
00:31:12 {Misato}      It's not her! 
00:31:13 {Misato}      Rei is gone, Shinji-kun.
00:31:15 {Shinji}      Liar! 
00:31:16 {Shinji}      I mean, she's right here, isn't she?!
00:31:18 {Shinji}      You're just dense, Misato-san! 
00:31:20 {Shinji}      I've had enough!
00:31:24 {Sakura}      Ikari-san!
00:31:27 {Sakura}      It's okay if you go back, but...
00:31:29 {Sakura}      Please, whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:31:31 {Sakura}      We really could use a break...
00:31:43 {Asuka}       Glasses, don't let it get away!
00:31:44 {Mari}        Loud and clear!
00:31:48 {Mari}        ♪ When you take aim ♪ 
00:31:50 {Mari}        ♪ Be careful not to miss your mark ♪
00:31:55 {Mari}        Hey, come on!
00:32:02 {Mari}        Got ya!
00:32:09 {Mari}        I knew it! An Adams' vessel?
00:32:17 {Mari}        At least say "hi" or something!
00:32:22 {Ritsuko}     The fact he was taken in priority over Eva-01 
00:32:25 {Ritsuko}     means he still has potential as a trigger!
00:32:27 {Ritsuko}     Misato! Use the DSS Choker!
00:32:44 {Ritsuko}     Mission directive from Executive Officer. 
00:32:46 {Ritsuko}     Pursuit unnecessary. 
00:32:47 {Ritsuko}     All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operations.
00:32:51 {Man}         Roger. 
00:32:52 {Man}         Pursuit unnecessary. 
00:32:53 {Asuka}       Hmph.
00:32:54 {Man}         All personnel, resume emergency damage control and camouflage operations.
00:32:55 {Asuka}       What do you know. 
00:32:56 {Asuka}       He's not an idiot, just a brat!
00:32:58 {Title}       Evangelion New Theatrical Edition: Quickening
00:33:16 {Shinji}      I did save her after all. 
00:33:18 {Shinji}      Misato-san lied to me.
00:33:21 {Rei}         This way.
00:33:31 {Shinji}      Um...
00:33:48 {Shinji}      Even though this is the Geofront, you can see the sky.
00:34:00 {Shinji}      Is that... Nerv Headquarters? 
00:34:04 {Shinji}      What happened?
00:34:36 {Shinji}      It really has been fourteen years.
00:35:15 {Rei}         Here.
00:35:19 {Shinji}      What's this? 
00:35:22 {Shinji}      An Eva...?
00:35:23 {Gendo}       That's right.
00:35:28 {Shinji}      Father...
00:35:30 {Gendo}       Evangelion 13.
00:35:32 {Gendo}       A unit for you and that pilot.
00:35:37 {Shinji}      The one on the piano earlier...
00:35:40 {Gendo}       When the time comes, pilot this Eva along with the boy. 
00:35:45 {Gendo}       We are done talking.
00:35:48 {Shinji}      Wait a second, Father! 
00:35:49 {Shinji}      I still have a lot of questions, a lot I want to talk about! 
00:35:53 {Shinji}      Father!
00:36:04 {Shinji}      There's no dial tone, 
00:36:06 {Shinji}      so I can't reach anyone from here.
00:36:29 {Shinji}      After all, I must thank her.
00:36:42 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:36:46 {Shinji}      Ayanami, where are you?
00:36:50 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:37:26 {Shinji}      What is this place?
00:37:30 {Shinji}      Ayanami?!
00:37:31 {Shinji}      There you are!
00:37:35 {Shinji}      Ayanami!
00:37:36 {Shinji}      I've been looking for you！
00:37:37 {Shinji}      Um. Ah, wait!
00:37:40 {Shinji}      Clothes! Put some clothes on!
00:37:44 {Rei}         If that is an order, I will do it.
00:37:48 {Shinji}      I'm coming in...
00:37:53 {Shinji}      Um, Ayanami, thank you for this. 
00:57:59 {Shinji}      I've been wanting to thank you for a while.
00:38:09 {Shinji}      You got a new plugsuit. 
00:38:12 {Shinji}      It suits you. Though black is a little...
00:38:21 {Shinji}      Nerv HQ has really changed a lot, hasn't it?
00:38:28 {Shinji}      Why is Misato-san fighting against Nerv and not the Angels?
00:38:33 {Shinji}      What does Father plan on doing here? 
00:38:36 {Shinji}      What's happened to everyone?
00:38:38 {Shinji}      Hey, Ayanami, do you know anything?
00:38:42 {Rei}         I do not.
00:38:43 {Shinji}      I see... 
00:38:46 {Shinji}      /Yeah, you may be right. {うん、そうかもな。}
00:38:49 {Shinji}      Say, when did you return from Eva-01?
00:38:59 {Shinji}      This place isn't much of a room.
00:39:03 {Shinji}      You could say it's just your style, 
00:39:06 {Shinji}      but it doesn't seem like there is school, so what do you do all the time?
00:39:10 {Rei}         Wait. For orders.
00:39:15 {Shinji}      There are no books here. 
00:39:17 {Shinji}      You're not reading any books?
00:39:19 {Rei}         Books?
00:39:21 {Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, would I read books?
00:39:24 {Shinji}      Yeah. You read a lot, didn't you?
00:39:27 {Shinji}      There were books in your room, too.
00:39:29 {Rei}         I see...
00:39:30 {Shinji}      I got it!
00:39:31 {Shinji}      I'll go look in the library here and bring you some.
00:39:34 {Shinji}      Um, English books are good, right? 
00:39:37 {Shinji}      You always had one on you, so I guess you liked them.
00:39:40 {Rei}         "Liked"...?
00:39:41 {Shinji}      Yeah... At least, I think so.
00:39:44 {Rei}         What is "liked"?
00:39:56 {Fuyutsuki}   So Seele are still maintaining their silence?
00:40:00 {Gendo}       The Human Instrumentality Project will be carried out according to the Dead Sea Scrolls.
00:40:05 {Gendo}       We no longer need to weave the story.
00:40:09 {Fuyutsuki}   Ikari, you intend to use Eva-13 this time?
00:40:15 {Fuyutsuki}   No matter. I will go along with your plan.
00:40:21 {Fuyutsuki}   For Yui-kun's sake.
00:40:25 {Shinji}      It's no use. It doesn't work. 
00:40:35 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:40:36 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:40:38 {Sakura}      Please, just don't pilot an Eva!
00:40:40 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:40:41 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:41:37 {Kaworu}      Come down here, Ikari-kun. 
00:41:39 {Kaworu}      Let's talk!
00:41:46 {Shinji}      Uh, aren't we going to talk?
00:41:49 {Kaworu}      A piano duet is a dialogue of sounds, you could say. 
00:41:52 {Kaworu}      Why don't we try it?
00:41:56 {Shinji}      No, that's alright. I can't play.
00:41:58 {Kaworu}      If you want to live well, you have to change and try new things.
00:42:08 {Kaworu}      Look, it's easy. 
00:42:09 {Kaworu}      You just have to hit this key here.
00:42:27 {Kaworu}      Now, follow along with me.
00:42:53 {Kaworu}      Very good! 
00:42:55 {Kaworu}      You're playing so well. 
00:43:32 {Kaworu}      Every note is a joy.
00:43:35 {Kaworu}      We're amazing together, aren't we?
00:43:42 {Shinji}      Thanks. 
00:44:44 {Shinji}      It's been ages since I've had this much fun.
00:43:46 {Kaworu}      Same here. 
00:43:48 {Kaworu}      We'll have to do this again. 
00:43:49 {Kaworu}      You can come anytime, Ikari Shinji-kun.
00:43:52 {Shinji}      Sure. 
00:43:53 {Shinji}      Oh, you are...?
00:43:55 {Kaworu}      I'm Kaworu, Nagisa Kaworu. 
00:43:59 {Kaworu}      I'm a child chosen by fate, the same as you.
00:44:08 {Shinji}      She's not here this time, either. 
00:44:11 {Shinji}      And the books still haven't been touched.
00:44:29 {Kaworu}      Good morning, Ikari Shinji-kun. 
00:44:33 {Kaworu}      You're here early today.
00:44:35 {Shinji}      I don't really have anything else to do.
00:45:07 {Shinji}      I wonder how I could play better...
00:45:10 {Kaworu}      You don't need to be good at playing it. 
00:45:13 {Kaworu}      Just producing a pleasing sound will suffice.
00:45:17 {Shinji}      So if I want to improve the sound I'm making, what should I do?
00:45:21 {Kaworu}      It takes repeated practice.
00:45:23 {Kaworu}      Doing it over and over, until it feels good enough to you.
00:45:30 {Kaworu}      That's the only way.
00:46:02 {Kaworu}      It's okay, leave it to me. 
00:46:03 {Kaworu}      You just need it to work, right?
00:46:05 {Shinji}      Yeah. Thank you. 
00:46:07 {Shinji}      I feel bad for making you do so much for me.
00:46:10 {Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about that. 
00:46:12 {Kaworu}      We're friends, after all.
00:46:18 {Kaworu}      It's gotten quite dark, hasn't it? 
00:46:20 {Kaworu}      Why don't we call it a day?
00:46:23 {Shinji}      Hey, why don't we stay here for a little longer?
00:45:26 {Shinji}      We could watch the stars from here.
00:46:28 {Kaworu}      The stars?
00:46:31 {Kaworu}      Do you like the stars?
00:46:34 {Shinji}      Yeah. 
00:46:36 {Shinji}      It's always struck me how large the universe is.
00:46:39 {Shinji}      There's something about it that's put my mind completely at ease, ever since I was little.
00:46:44 {Shinji}      I guess I'm glad that it hasn't changed at all these past fourteen years. 
00:46:49 {Shinji}      Or maybe it makes me feel marginalized, but in a good way, if that makes sense.
00:46:55 {Shinji}      Uh, it's hard to put into words.
00:46:58 {Kaworu}      Your feelings came through.
00:47:01 {Kaworu}      Instead of seeking change, you prefer a world of nothingness and brutal abyss.
00:47:06 {Kaworu}      It's like you.
00:47:09 {Kaworu}      Lying here together is nice.
00:47:12 {Kaworu}      I didn't know it could be so pleasant.
00:47:15 {Kaworu}      Thanks for inviting me.
00:47:18 {Shinji}      No, you don't need to.
00:47:20 {Shinji}      I just thought that it'd be fun, if you wanted to try it, and...
00:47:27 {Kaworu}      It is fun.
00:47:30 {Kaworu}      I really was born to meet you.
00:47:44 {Shinji}      Hm?
00:47:50 {Shinji}      Seems a little big this time.
00:47:53 {Shinji}      Huh?
00:47:55 {Tag}         Suzuhara Toji
00:48:00 {Kaworu}      Here, it should work now.
00:48:03 {Shinji}      Thanks. 
00:48:04 {Shinji}      You're amazing, Nagisa-kun. 
00:48:06 {Shinji}      You can do everything.
00:48:08 {Kaworu}      This is just knowledge. 
00:48:10 {Kaworu}      It's because I've stayed in this world for a little longer than you.
00:48:14 {Shinji}      Still... you're incredible.
00:48:18 {Kaworu}      You don't look too well. 
00:48:20 {Kaworu}      What's wrong?
00:48:25 {Shinji}      I'm worried about my friends.
00:48:29 {Kaworu}      Friends?
00:48:30 {Shinji}      Yeah. 
00:48:32 {Shinji}      There was a city above Nerv HQ. 
00:48:35 {Shinji}      That's where everyone lived.
00:48:37 {Shinji}      Toji, Kensuke, 
00:48:38 {Shinji}      the class rep, my other classmates...
00:48:41 {Shinji}      Apparently I'd been sleeping in Eva-01 for fourteen years.
00:48:45 {Shinji}      I don't know what's changed in that time.
00:48:50 {Kaworu}      Not knowing the answer to that must be painful.
00:48:54 {Shinji}      Somehow, I'm scared.
00:48:57 {Shinji}      Of what's happened to the city and everybody...
00:49:02 {Shinji}      I'm scared of it for some reason.
00:49:04 {Shinji}      That's right, I'm scared!
00:49:15 {Kaworu}      Do you want to know?
00:49:44 {Shinji}      Nagisa-kun?
00:49:46 {Shinji}      Nagisa-kun!
00:50:03 {Kaworu}      Just a little longer now.
00:50:22 {Kaworu}      The clouds will disperse soon, 
00:50:24 {Kaworu}      and you will see the truth you desire.
00:50:36 {Shinji}      What is this...?
00:50:42 {Kaworu}      The outcome of Third Impact, which came to pass while you were merged with Eva-01.
00:50:51 {Shinji}      But this is... 
00:50:53 {Shinji}      What happened to everyone in the city?
00:50:55 {Kaworu}      Mass extinction is not unusual on this planet.
00:50:58 {Kaworu}      Rather, it is an aspect that drives evolution.
00:51:02 {Kaworu}      Because life is fundamentally something that adjusts to the world and changes itself.
00:51:08 {Kaworu}      However, Lilin do not change themselves, but the world.
00:51:15 {Kaworu}      So they brought the rite of artificial evolution unto themselves.
00:51:21 {Kaworu}      Old life is offered in sacrifice, 
00:51:23 {Kaworu}      so that new beings blessed with the Fruit of Life may be created.
00:51:29 {Kaworu}      All this is due to the death instinct that's been programmed since time immemorial.
00:51:33 {Kaworu}      Nerv call it the Human Instrumentality Project.
00:51:38 {Shinji}      This is Nerv's...
00:51:43 {Shinji}      This is what my father was doing.
00:51:48 {Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun, 
00:51:50 {Kaworu}      once Awakened, Eva-01 opened the Door of Guf 
00:51:55 {Kaworu}      and became the trigger for Third Impact.
00:51:58 {Kaworu}      Lilin call it Near Third Impact. 
00:52:02 {Kaworu}      It was all initiated by you.
00:52:09 {Shinji}      You're wrong! 
00:52:10 {Shinji}      All I did was save Ayanami!
00:52:16 {Kaworu}      True, but that was the catalyst...
00:52:21 {Shinji}      All this... 
00:52:25 {Shinji}      I didn't know! 
00:52:27 {Shinji}      You're telling me all of this so fast, 
00:52:29 {Shinji}      and there's nothing I can do about it!
00:52:30 {Kaworu}      Indeed. 
00:52:31 {Kaworu}      There's nothing you can do about your past.
00:52:35 {Kaworu}      The truth you desired to know.
00:52:38 {Kaworu}      The Lilin are providing you reparation for your sin as a result.
00:52:43 {Kaworu}      That's what the thing on your neck is, no?
00:52:48 {Shinji}      What sin? 
00:52:50 {Shinji}      I didn't do anything!
00:52:52 {Shinji}      I had nothing to do with it!
00:52:54 {Kaworu}      If it wasn't you, then who was it?
00:52:58 {Kaworu}      However, no sin is beyond redemption.
00:53:02 {Kaworu}      There is always hope. 
00:53:04 {Kaworu}      Always.
00:53:23 {Fuyutsuki}   Seele's boy has contacted the Third Boy.
00:53:27 {Fuyutsuki}   He showed him the conditions outside, it seems.
00:53:30 {Fuyutsuki}   Was his reaction as you anticipated?
00:53:33 {Fuyutsuki}   Are you okay with all of this, Ikari?
00:53:35 {Gendo}       Seele's scenario is being rewritten by us.
00:53:39 {Gendo}       All existence is nothing more than a tool to that end.
00:53:42 {Fuyutsuki}   You assume that your son wouldn't even benefit from seeing how you live?
00:53:48 {Fuyutsuki}   I don't agree with that.
00:53:53 {Shinji}      What is...
00:53:56 {Shinji}      What am I supposed--
00:54:03 {Shinji}      Right... I saved Ayanami.
00:54:06 {Shinji}      Wasn't that the right thing?
00:54:32 {Shinji}      She's gone again. 
00:54:34 {Shinji}      She still hasn't touched the books.
00:54:38 {Shinji}      What's going on...? 
00:54:40 {Shinji}      What's wrong with Ayanami?!
00:54:53 {Fuyutsuki}   Third Boy, do you play shogi?
00:54:57 {Shinji}      Eh... I only sort of know the rules.
00:55:00 {Fuyutsuki}   That's fine. Choose a side.
00:55:03 {Fuyutsuki}   I'll start without a castle, bishop, and golden general.
00:55:12 {Fuyutsuki}   Let your mind be still.
00:55:16 {Fuyutsuki}   It's the only way to achieve victory.
00:55:19 {Fuyutsuki}   You'll lose in another thirty-one turns.
00:55:24 {Fuyutsuki}   Hmm... 
00:55:31 {Fuyutsuki}   Is it more fun for you this way?
00:55:35 {Fuyutsuki}   Thank you for indulging an old man his hobby.
00:55:43 {Fuyutsuki}   I'm a coward too, you know. 
00:55:45 {Fuyutsuki}   I used this game as a pretext to talk to you.
00:55:50 {Fuyutsuki}   Do you remember your mother?
00:55:54 {Shinji}      No. I was too small. 
00:55:58 {Shinji}      Father got rid of everything that was hers.
00:56:07 {Shinji}      Is this... 
00:56:10 {Shinji}      Ayanami?
00:56:13 {Fuyutsuki}   Your mother. 
00:56:14 {Fuyutsuki}   Maiden name, Ayanami Yui.
00:56:16 {Fuyutsuki}   She was my student at the university.
00:56:20 {Fuyutsuki}   Now, she is the control system of Eva Unit 01.
00:56:27 {Fuyutsuki}   Hm. The power was finally restored.
00:56:33 {Fuyutsuki}   The control system from very early in the Evas' development.
00:56:37 {Fuyutsuki}   Here, Yui-kun proposed direct entry into cores,
00:56:41 {Fuyutsuki}   and tested it with herself as the experimentee.
00:56:45 {Fuyutsuki}   You were watching, too. Your memory must have been erased.
00:56:55 {Fuyutsuki}   The result was that Yui-kun vanished here,
00:56:59 {Fuyutsuki}   and only her data was recovered, in the Ayanami Series.
00:57:03 {Fuyutsuki}   The Rei you know is one of Yui-kun's clones.
00:57:08 {Fuyutsuki}   She is preserved within Eva-01, the same as your mother.
00:57:13 {Fuyutsuki}   All of it is Ikari's plan.
00:57:17 {Shinji}      No way...
00:57:20 {Fuyutsuki}   Breaking the world is not difficult.
00:57:24 {Fuyutsuki}   But rebuilding it, that isn't so easy.
00:57:28 {Fuyutsuki}   The world can be reversed no more than time.
00:57:32 {Fuyutsuki}   Nor even the human heart...
00:57:35 {Fuyutsuki}   And thus, so that his wish might be granted,
00:57:38 {Fuyutsuki}   Ikari is paying every price there is.
00:57:41 {Fuyutsuki}   Even his very soul.
00:57:44 {Fuyutsuki}   I've imparted to you a little of the truth.
00:57:47 {Fuyutsuki}   About your father, as well...
00:58:01 {Fuyutsuki}   I could have been given a more pleasant part to play.
00:58:04 {Fuyutsuki}   Yui-kun, this should do.
00:58:15 {Gendo}       The time of the final contract is upon us.
00:58:20 {Gendo}       We shall meet soon, Yui.
00:58:31 {Shinji}      Why aren't you reading the books?
00:58:36 {Rei}         That wasn't your order.
00:58:38 {Shinji}      "Order"...?
00:58:40 {Shinji}      Alright, enough of that!
00:58:45 {Shinji}      You are Ayanami, right...?
00:58:48 {Rei}         Yes, Ayanami Rei.
00:58:51 {Shinji}      Then I did save you, right...?
00:58:55 {Rei}         ...I don't know.
00:59:04 {Rei}         Ikari-kun...?
00:59:11 {Shinji}      So, I didn't actually save her...
00:59:15 {Shinji}      Ayanami...
00:59:17 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:21 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:21 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:23 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:27 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:29 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:32 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:33 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:34 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:36 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:39 {Shinji}      Father...
00:59:40 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:41 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:42 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:43 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:44 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:45 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:46 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:46 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:48 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:48 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:49 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:51 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
00:59:52 {Misato}      Do nothing.
00:59:53 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:53 {Asuka}       ...your business.
00:59:54 {Rei}         I don't know.
00:59:55 {Asuka}       None of your business.
00:59:56 {Sakura}      Whatever you do, don't pilot an Eva!
00:59:59 {Rei}         I don't know.
01:00:00 {Gendo}       Pilot the Eva.
01:00:08 {Shinji}      What did I do?
01:00:47 {Fuyutsuki}   Has the final executor been completed?
01:00:50 {Gendo}       Yes, everything we need is right here.
01:00:56 {Kaworu}      The time has come.
01:00:59 {Kaworu}      This is it, Ikari Shinji-kun.
01:01:02 {Shinji}      No!
01:01:05 {Shinji}      I don't want to pilot an Eva anymore!
01:01:07 {Shinji}      I didn't save Ayanami after all!
01:01:10 {Shinji}      Nothing good came out of me piloting an Eva!
01:01:13 {Shinji}      I've had enough! I don't want to do anything!
01:01:16 {Kaworu}      And so, the refrain of bitter memories will keep good things from happening.
01:01:24 {Shinji}      Nothing is ever good!
01:01:26 {Shinji}      You were the one who showed me that, Nagisa-kun.
01:01:29 {Shinji}      A world where I can't do anything!
01:01:32 {Kaworu}      That which was changed by Eva can be changed back by Eva in turn.
01:01:37 {Shinji}      You say that, but my father, Eva, Misato-san...
01:01:39 {Shinji}      I can't believe in anyone, or anything!
01:01:43 {Kaworu}      Still, I want you to believe in me.
01:01:46 {Shinji}      I can't!
01:01:49 {Shinji}      Misato-san had this thing put on me!
01:01:53 {Shinji}      They said to never pilot an Eva again.
01:01:55 {Shinji}      They said if I pilot, I'll die.
01:01:59 {Shinji}      I don't care about Eva anymore.
01:02:09 {Kaworu}      I understand.
01:02:10 {Kaworu}      For you, I will shoulder the burden of the Lilin's curse and the risk of Eva's Awakening.
01:02:21 {Shinji}      Nagisa-kun...
01:02:24 {Kaworu}      No need to worry.
01:02:26 {Kaworu}      The Lilin originally created this due to their fear of me.
01:02:29 {Kaworu}      I intended to take it from you at some point.
01:02:34 {Kaworu}      Ikari Shinji-kun, your only hope lies with the two Spears left at the Impact epicenter in Dogma.
01:02:41 {Kaworu}      They are the key to activating Instrumentality.
01:02:45 {Kaworu}      All we have to do is obtain those Spears.
01:02:48 {Kaworu}      If we do that, Nerv will not be able to cause Fourth Impact.
01:02:52 {Kaworu}      And if we use them together with Eva-13, it becomes possible to fix the world.
01:02:58 {Shinji}      I see...
01:03:03 {Shinji}      Yes. It is possible for you.
01:03:05 {Kaworu}      It is possible WITH you.
01:03:07 {Kaworu}      Eva-13 uses a double entry system.
01:03:11 {Kaworu}      Let the two of us become the hope of the Lilin.
01:03:15 {Kaworu}      Because what you need the most right now is hope,
01:03:19 {Kaworu}      along with atonement and an open heart.
01:03:25 {Shinji}      You're amazing. You know everything.
01:03:30 {Kaworu}      That's because I am always thinking about you.
01:03:35 {Shinji}      Thank you, Nagisa-kun.
01:03:38 {Kaworu}      "Kaworu" is fine.
01:03:40 {Shinji}      Ah, okay. 
01:03:43 {Shinji}      "Shinji" is fine for me, too.
01:03:49 {Kaworu}      It is the same as playing piano. 
01:03:50 {Kaworu}      Good things will come if we do it together.
01:03:56 {Shinji}      Let's go, Kaworu-kun.
01:04:38 {Both}        Evangelion 13, start up!
01:04:43 {Aoba}        Incoming signal! 
01:04:44 {Aoba}        Activation of a new type of Eva confirmed.
01:05:06 {Shinji}      We're not alone.
01:05:08 {Kaworu}      You mean the Mark.09? 
01:05:08 {Kaworu}      It's here as our backup.
01:05:12 {Kaworu}      It will warn us of any Wille activity.
01:05:15 {Shinji}      The two of us should be enough for all that.
01:05:18 {Shinji}      She isn't even Ayanami...
01:05:22 {Rei}         Not... Ayanami?
01:05:28 {Shinji}      The walls...?
01:05:30 {Kaworu}      Yes, all failures of infinity.
01:05:38 {Kaworu}      Don't let them weigh upon your mind.
01:05:42 {Kaworu}      We're nearly at Lilith's barrier.
01:05:45 {Kaworu}      The Main Shaft is completely blocked,
01:05:47 {Kaworu}      keeping anyone from intruding over the past fourteen years.
01:05:56 {Shinji}      It's like one big lid.
01:06:00 {Kaworu}      It's all right. Eva-13 was made for breaking through this.
01:06:03 {Kaworu}      The two of us can do it.
01:06:15 {Kaworu}      Try to join tempos. 
01:06:17 {Kaworu}      Remember the piano duet.
01:06:24 {Kaworu}      Let's go, Shinji-kun.
01:06:48 {Shinji}      We did it!
01:07:07 {Kaworu}      We've arrived. The deepest part of Central Dogma.
01:07:14 {Kaworu}      The epicenter of Third Impact.
01:07:21 {Shinji}      Is this Lilith?
01:07:23 {Kaworu}      It once was. 
01:07:25 {Kaworu}      Now, it is her corpse.
01:07:27 {Shinji}      Misato-san, even though we tried to protect it with our lives...
01:07:32 {Shinji}      Uh... That's an Eva?
01:07:35 {Kaworu}      Yes, the Eva Mark.06.
01:07:38 {Kaworu}      Remodeled into an autonomous type, 
01:07:40 {Kaworu}      exploitation by the Lilin brought the unit to a state of ruin.
01:07:48 {Shinji}      The things that are piercing them... are our targets?
01:07:52 {Kaworu}      Yes, the Spears of Longinus and Cassius. 
01:07:55 {Kaworu}      Wielding both requires two souls.
01:08:00 {Kaworu}      That is why we have the double entry system.
01:08:04 {Shinji}      Then... wouldn't that pilot have been just as good for this as me?
01:08:08 {Kaworu}      No, a Lilin imitation cannot be used.
01:08:10 {Kaworu}      Their souls' placement is different.
01:08:14 {Kaworu}      Well, let's begin.
01:08:23 {Kaworu}      Hold on. 
01:08:25 {Kaworu}      Something is wrong.
01:08:26 {Shinji}      What is it, Kaworu-kun?
01:08:31 {Kaworu}      This is not right... 
01:08:32 {Kaworu}      Both of the Spears have changed to a similar shape.
01:08:36 {Shinji}      Let's just pull the Spears quickly!
01:08:38 {Shinji}      That's why we came here in this Eva.
01:08:44 {Shinji}      What's going on?!
01:08:55 {Shinji}      Eva-02?
01:08:57 {Shinji}      Asuka!
01:09:00 {Shinji}      What are you doing, Asuka?!
01:09:05 {Asuka}       Stupid Shinji?!
01:09:06 {Asuka}       You can't seriously be piloting an Eva?
01:09:08 {Shinji}      I am. 
01:09:10 {Shinji}      I'm going to change the world with this Eva!
01:09:13 {Asuka}       You little brat...
01:09:15 {Asuka}       If that's how it is, don't pilot!
01:09:25 {Asuka}       Support fire, you're always late!
01:09:26 {Mari}        Sorry, sorry!
01:09:28 {Mari}        Adams' Vessel-san,
01:09:31 {Mari}        the least I can do is get you to stick around. 
01:09:54 {Shinji}      Why are you interfering, Asuka?
01:09:56 {Shinji}      Those are our Spears of Hope!
01:10:01 {Asuka}       Stop!... looking!... for trouble!
01:10:04 {Asuka}       You brat, Shinji!
01:10:05 {Asuka}       Are you planning to start Third Impact again?
01:10:07 {Shinji}      You're wrong! 
01:10:09 {Shinji}      I'm trying to fix everything!
01:10:12 {Shinji}      I'm trying to save the world!
01:10:16 {Asuka}       You really are a little twerp.
01:10:19 {Shinji}      You just don't get it!
01:10:30 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun, why aren't you helping?
01:10:34 {Kaworu}      Cassius and Longinus. Both of the Spears are needed...
01:10:39 {Kaworu}      But the only two Spears that are here are the same...
01:10:43 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!
01:10:44 {Kaworu}      That's it! 
01:10:46 {Kaworu}      Now I understand,
01:10:48 {Kaworu}      Lilin!
01:10:55 {Mari}        Hey, Ms. Sucks To Be Seele's Pilot,
01:10:58 {Mari}        you can hear me, right?
01:11:00 {Mari}        Don't you think you should get out before you turn into an Adams' Vessel?
01:11:04 {Rei}         No. That is not the order I received.
01:11:07 {Mari}        Talk about a square.
01:11:09 {Mari}        You know your original was a whole lot more friendly?
01:11:12 {Rei}         Original?
01:11:14 {Rei}         The other me...
01:11:30 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun? What's the matter?
01:11:45 {Shinji}      Asuka... 
01:11:46 {Shinji}      Please! Stay out of our way!
01:11:49 {Asuka}       Go down quietly, you little brat!
01:11:57 {Asuka}       Of all times! 
01:11:58 {Asuka}       Hey, Glasses! I need a spare!
01:12:07 {Shinji}      While we still have the chance! The Spears!
01:12:11 {Asuka}       You'd raise a hand against a girl... 
01:12:13 {Asuka}       You're the worst.
01:12:14 {Mari}        Spare, incoming!
01:12:28 {Kaworu}      Let's stop, Shinji-kun. 
01:12:30 {Kaworu}      I have a bad feeling about this...
01:12:32 {Shinji}      We can't, Kaworu-kun! 
01:12:34 {Shinji}      We came here to do something!
01:12:37 {Kaworu}      We've done enough!
01:12:38 {Kaworu}      These aren't the Spears we came for!
01:12:41 {Shinji}      Not... the Spears we came for...
01:12:47 {Shinji}      You're the one who said we need the Spears.
01:12:50 {Shinji}      That's why I got into this Eva!
01:12:57 {Kaworu}      The control system...?
01:13:02 {Shinji}      For Kaworu-kun, 
01:13:05 {Shinji}      for everyone, I will get the Spears!
01:13:07 {Shinji}      Only then will the world go back to the way it should be.
01:13:11 {Shinji}      If I do that, even Misato-san will...
01:13:15 {Asuka}       Damn!
01:13:16 {Asuka}       Glasses! Get rid of the barrier!
01:13:18 {Asuka}       You're cleared to use AA ammo!
01:13:20 {Mari}        I've been waiting for this.
01:13:22 {Mari}        Check these babies out!
01:13:30 {Mari}        No A.T. Field?
01:13:32 {Mari}        Don't tell me this unit...
01:13:46 {Kaworu}      Don't do it, Shinji-kun!
01:13:48 {Asuka}       Stop, you stupid brat!
01:14:13 {Gendo}       Let's begin, Fuyutsuki.
01:14:22 {Shinji}      Eva Mark.06?
01:14:25 {Shinji}      Pattern blue? 
01:14:26 {Shinji}      What's going on?
01:14:30 {Asuka}       This is bad! 
01:14:32 {Asuka}       The 12th Angel is still alive!
01:14:35 {Asuka}       Glasses, Container No.3!
01:14:37 {Mari}        Got it!
01:14:40 {Asuka}       I'll deal with this before Third Impact starts up again!
01:14:49 {Rei}         It was on orders.
01:15:00 {Shinji}      An Angel?!
01:15:10 {Mari}        Princess, you should cease the futile fire. 
01:15:14 {Mari}        The whole thing is a core.
01:15:17 {Mari}        With just us, there's no way to hurt it. 
01:15:21 {Mari}        Besides that, by defeating the Last Angel,
01:15:24 {Mari}        we don't know what kind of evil will come out.
01:15:26 {Mari}        You're worried, no?
01:15:32 {Rei}         This is...
01:15:37 {Rei}         This is... me?
01:15:41 {Rei}         What am I...?
01:15:46 {Shinji}      The controls aren't responding. 
01:15:47 {Shinji}      What's going on, Kaworu-kun?
01:15:51 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!
01:15:53 {Kaworu}      I never imagined that I, the First Angel,
01:15:56 {Kaworu}      would be cast down to the Thirteenth.
01:16:00 {Shinji}      What are you doing, Kaworu-kun?
01:16:04 {Kaworu}      So the beginning and the end are the same.
01:16:08 {Kaworu}      I'd expected as much from the King of the Lilin,
01:16:11 {Kaworu}      Shinji-kun's father!
01:16:13 {Mari}        DSS Choker, pattern blue?
01:16:15 {Mari}        A thirteenth? Even though the Twelfth should be the last?!
01:16:19 {Mari}        So this is what Gendo-kun is aiming for.
01:16:24 {Gendo}       It is time to amend the Dead Sea Scrolls' contract.
01:16:29 {Gendo}       This is farewell.
01:16:33 {Gendo}       Even though all of you have changed the shape of your souls,
01:16:37 {Gendo}       you are still lifeforms blessed with the Fruit of Knowledge.
01:16:41 {Gendo}       You were able to live for eternity,
01:16:44 {Gendo}       but, same as us, you still cannot escape the fate of death.
01:16:50 {Gendo}       To advance the evolution of the flock burdened with death,
01:16:54 {Gendo}       you had bestowed upon us the gift of civilization.
01:17:00 {Gendo}       As the representative of humanity, I say thank you.
01:17:04 {Gendo}       Through death, I shall return your souls to where they belong.
01:17:12 {Gendo}       The long desired Human Instrumentality Project,
01:17:15 {Gendo}       and the contracted deicide, will be completed by me.
01:17:19 {Gendo}       Rest assured.
01:17:21 {Keel}        Our wishes have come to fruition. 
01:17:25 {Keel}        Good.
01:17:26 {Keel}        Everything is good. 
01:17:29 {Keel}        Human Instrumentality.
01:17:31 {Keel}        We hope for the peaceful purification of all souls.
01:18:06 {Asuka}       Damn it! 
01:18:07 {Asuka}       It's entering its pseudo-evolved form!
01:18:09 {Mari}        Guess it's Awakening...
01:18:12 {Mari}        It's a surviving Adams!
01:18:49 {Shinji}      What's this...?
01:19:04 {Shinji}      What IS this...?
01:19:11 {Shinji}      It's all my fault!
01:19:14 {Shinji}      Because I pulled the Spears!
01:19:22 {Shinji}      This is...!
01:19:24 {Kaworu}      Fourth Impact...
01:19:28 {Kaworu}      These are the opening ceremonies.
01:19:45 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun... 
01:19:46 {Shinji}      The choker!
01:19:55 {Shinji}      Misato-san?!
01:19:59 {Misato}      A.T. Field at maximum!
01:20:01 {Misato}      Contain the Eva in its present state!
01:20:03 {Misato}      Prepare the main armaments for a salvo! Load the mortar shells!
01:20:06 {Misato}      Do whatever it takes to keep Fourth Impact in check!
01:20:08 {Misato}      Fire!
01:20:17 {Midori}      Damage received! Direct hit to main armament!
01:20:19 {Misato}      The Adams' Vessel?!
01:20:26 {Tama}        Shots received on midsection! Damage unknown!
01:20:28 {Woman (BG)}  / The target is the new-type Eva! ＃＃＃＃
01:20:30 {Sumire}      Rudder is ineffective!
01:20:32 {Sumire}      We're losing altitude!
01:20:43 {Tama}        / 中＃＃＃＃＃＃！
01:20:46 {Ritsuko}     The Adams' Vessel... Wunder's original master!
01:20:48 {Ritsuko}     It intends to take the ship's controls back from Eva-01!
01:20:57 {Rei}         Why can't I restore the link?
01:21:05 {Mari}        Oh, man! 
01:21:07 {Mari}        These guys are not messing around.
01:21:10 {Asuka}       Glasses, you handle the brat's Eva!
01:21:12 {Asuka}       I'll help out Wunder with 02'!
01:21:14 {Mari}        Roger!
01:21:15 {Midori}      Unable to reject the Adams' Vessel!
01:21:17 {Tama}        Unidentified data is infiltrating the main control system!
01:21:19 {Aoba}        It's hijacking control of the ship!
01:21:43 {Asuka}       Talk about cheap! That's Seele's style, all right.
01:21:53 {Asuka}       Mode change!
01:21:55 {Asuka}       Code 777!
01:22:04 {Rei}         Who's there?
01:22:05 {Asuka}       Who the hell are YOU?!
01:22:24 {Aoba}        Report from lower bridge. 
01:22:26 {Aoba}        Eva-02' has engaged the Adams' Vessel!
01:22:27 {Misato}      We're counting on you, Asuka.
01:22:48 {Rei}         If I were Ayanami Rei, what would I do at a time like this?
01:22:51 {Asuka}       Hell if I know!
01:22:52 {Asuka}       Do whatever you want!
01:22:58 {Asuka}       And now, for the core!
01:23:09 {Asuka}       Geez! The whole thing's a core?
01:23:12 {Asuka}       No time...
01:23:14 {Asuka}       Sorry, Eva-02!
01:23:31 {Sumire}      Control systems restored!
01:23:33 {Misato}      Emergency launch of all ships! 
01:23:34 {Misato}      Pursue the target Eva immediately!
01:23:36 {Ritsuko}     Captain, it won't be possible until the main unit is restored!
01:23:40 {Misato}      Shinji-kun...
01:24:02 {Shinji}      This is all because of me...
01:24:06 {Shinji}      I...
01:24:12 {Kaworu}      It's not your fault.
01:24:15 {Kaworu}      It's because I became the Thirteenth Angel.
01:24:19 {Kaworu}      I'm the trigger.
01:24:21 {Shinji}      What do I do?
01:24:24 {Shinji}      Hey, what are we going to do?
01:24:31 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun,
01:24:34 {Shinji}      tell me what the right thing would be.
01:24:37 {Kaworu}      Even if souls disappear, hopes and curses will remain in this world.
01:24:43 {Kaworu}      Intent is imparted to the world as information and goes on to change.
01:24:48 {Kaworu}      In time, even one's very self is being rewritten.
01:24:54 {Kaworu}      I'm sorry. This isn't the happiness you wished for.
01:24:59 {Kaworu}      I will close the Door of Guf.
01:25:03 {Kaworu}      You don't need to worry about it, Shinji-kun.
01:25:05 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun...
01:25:08 {Shinji}      What are you saying, Kaworu-kun?
01:25:11 {Shinji}      I don't get any of it!
01:25:18 {Kaworu}      Shinji-kun, you should find a place of peace and self.
01:25:31 {Kaworu}      Fate will surely guide you.
01:25:37 {Kaworu}      Don't make that face.
01:25:41 {Kaworu}      We'll meet again, Shinji-kun.
01:25:44 {Shinji}      Kaworu-kun!
01:26:04 {Mari}        The Door of Guf hasn't closed yet?
01:26:06 {Mari}        So, Puppy Boy is Seele's backup measure!
01:26:25 {Mari}        I'm done cleaning up! 
01:26:26 {Mari}        Hang in there, Puppy Boy!
01:26:30 {Mari}        Don't be such a baby! 
01:26:31 {Mari}        Help out the Princess, at least! 
01:26:33 {Mari}        Be a man! 
01:26:36 {Mari}        And while you're at it, get to know the world a little!
01:27:33 {Fuyutsuki}   What a nightmare. 
01:27:35 {Fuyutsuki}   Nearly all went as Seele intended. 
01:27:38 {Gendo}       But not only was Seele's boy eliminated, the path was forged for Eva-13's Awakening.
01:27:46 {Gendo}       Captain Katsuragi's actions are within predictions, as well.
01:27:49 {Gendo}       This will do for now.
01:27:52 {Hyuga}       All ships, maintain organization for Class Two withdrawal.
01:27:55 {Woman}       No pattern blue readings.
01:27:57 {Woman}       No ships sighted in withdrawal airspace.
01:27:59 {Man}         Damaged areas of the midsection have received emergency treatment.
01:28:01 {Ritsuko}     Fourth Impact was stopped, but we don't know whom to thank.
01:28:07 {Ritsuko}     Misato, let's leave it for now...
01:29:01 {Asuka}       You brat, Shinji.
01:29:04 {Asuka}       You didn't come to help me?
01:29:10 {Asuka}       Yet again, it's all about you.
01:29:12 {Asuka}       You think you can just get away with what's happened by not saying a thing.
01:29:40 {Asuka}       You still need babying?
01:29:43 {Asuka}       No matter how much time passes... you're always such a brat!
01:29:47 {Asuka}       Here, put this on.
01:29:50 {Asuka}       Jeez! You can stand on your own, can't you?!
01:29:58 {Asuka}       You're the pilot from before.
01:30:02 {Asuka}       From an early lot of Ayanami types, are you?
01:30:11 {Asuka}       The L Barrier's density is too strong here, so they won't come to help us.
01:30:16 {Asuka}       We're going to where the Lilin can pick us up.
01:30:23 {Asuka}       Come on!
